<h2>Project Name: Twitter Sentiment analysis</h2>
  
<h4>Week 1:</h4>
1. Defining the flow of the Project.
2. Exploring machine learning packages used for gathering news feeds and the twitter feeds.
3. Registered the application for generating api key for runnig newsapi and tweepy api.
4. Getting familiar with the news feed api for the implementation.
5. Getting familiar with the twitter api for querying on the context.

<h4>Week 2:</h4>
1. Gathered data from newsapi for the lastest news from different region and categories.
2. Also, collecting data from tweepy api for real time twitter feeds.
3. Cleaning twitter feeds for the proper sentiment analysis.
4. Exploratory data analysis on the twitter feeds.
3. Implemented Baseline NLP model for sentiment analysis.
4. Implemented 1st draft for NLP model using Random Forest for Twitter sentiment analysis.
5. Given a try for plotting geography coordinates from twitter feeds on map using bokeh google map package.
6. As per real time Twitter feed data we are getting almost <10% of data with geography coordinates which wont be sufficient for plotting and making correct analysis.

<h4>Week 3:</h4>
1. Pipelining the whole process.
2. Dockerizing the Model implementation and sentiment analysis.
3. Planning to incoroprate the Kafka for the fault tolerence handling.
4. Also, we wil try to use spark for the real time streaming of the twitter feeds and plotting visualization on the sentiments.
Implementing Flask Application.
