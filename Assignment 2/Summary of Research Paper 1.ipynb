    "3) The highest correlation is observed between NSM and appliances with a value of 0.22. Also there is a positive correlation with appliances consumption and wind speed with a value of 0.09, higher wind speeds correlate with higher energy consumption by the appliances.<br>\n",

    "1) Initially, Multiple Linear Regression Model was trained which uses all the predictors and finds the appropriate slope quantifying the effect of each predictor and the response. The residuals were computed as the difference between the real values and the predicted values. The linear model could not identify the relationship between variables and energy consumption efficiently due to residuals being not distributed normally along horizontal axis.<br>\n",
    "2) Support Vector Machines with radial basis kernel function was trained next which has numerical advantages which are helpful in this study. <br>\n",

    "1) The consumption of appliances represents the highest percentage of electrical consumption with almost 75% of monthly consumption.<br>\n",
    "2) During Exploratory Data Analysis, the correlation between some of the features was high for ex: T5 and T8 and so only the most representative ones can be used for the predictions.<br>\n",
    "3) The relation between Humidity and appliances consumption was found to be very good, as the number of occupants in the room increases, the humidity in the room increases and hence energy consumption increases.<br>\n",
    "4) The data filtering is important as it diminishes some of features which have no use in predictions. According to RFE, the six parameters can significantly reduce the RMSE which are: NSM, lights, pressure, RH5, T3 and RH3.<br>\n",
    "5) When looking at the ranking for the GBM model with no light information (see Fig. 17), it can be seen that the top predictors are the NSM, Pressure, RH1, RH2, RH3, RH5, T6, RH6, RH4, RH9, T8, T4, and T2 which means that information from the kitchen, living room, laundry room, bathroom, outdoors, office, and bedrooms are the most important.<br>\n"
